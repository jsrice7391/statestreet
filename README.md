# Transaction Table
This is a table that is built to show a large table of transactions and be able to filter on them. Each transation contains a link that goes to a different rendered component using React Router.

### Key Tools Used
- React Router

### Key points
I chose to make my application within React. When I build my React applications, I tend to organize my SRC folder such that all of my stateful componentns are within a "pages" folder and all of my stateless componenents are in a folder called "stateless."
